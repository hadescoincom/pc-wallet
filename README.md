Things that make HDS special include:

* Users have complete control over privacy - a user decides which information will be available and to which parties, having complete control over his personal data in accordance to his will and applicable laws.
* Confidentiality without penalty - in HDS confidential transactions do not cause bloating of the blockchain, avoiding excessive computational overhead or penalty on performance or scalability while completely concealing the transaction value.
* No trusted setup required
* Blocks are mined using Equihash Proof-of-Work algorithm.
* Limited emission using periodic halving.
* No addresses are stored in the blockchain - no information whatsoever about either the sender or the receiver of a transaction is stored in the blockchain.
* Superior scalability through compact blockchain size - using the “cut-through” feature of
Mimblewimble makes the HDS blockchain orders of magnitude smaller than any other
blockchain implementation.
* HDS supports many transaction types such as escrow transactions, time locked
transactions, atomic swaps and more.
* No premine. No ICO. Backed by a treasury, emitted from every block during the first five
years.
* Implemented from scratch in C++.
